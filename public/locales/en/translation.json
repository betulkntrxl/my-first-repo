    "title": "You can ask ChatApp a question using the textbox below. Please keep the following in mind when using this tool:",
    "bullet1": "ChatApp is a business safe alternative to the public ChatGPT application. It uses the Azure OpenAI GPT 35 Turbo model which was trained on public internet information through mid 2021 so it will not be aware of current events. It was not trained on any McKesson specific information. It will not give you any useful information on McKesson benefits, policies, etc.",
    "bullet2": "It can be used to summarize short documents, for writing assistance (generating suggested text for emails, etc.), and asking general questions about publicly available internet information.",
    "bullet3": "DO NOT input any personal information of any kind into the ChatApp, in particular any sensitive personal information (e.g. personal health information, financial information of any individual, the personal information of children, etc.)",
    "bullet4": "DO NOT use the ChatApp as a sole decision maker with regard to any services provided to any patient or customer of McKesson.",
    "bullet5": "All responses should be quality checked because Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI’s GPT models can make up facts yet sound truthful. Summarizing and writing assistance are the best uses at this time. Use good judgment before relying on or sharing ChatApp responses as they may not always be accurate. Pressure test and verify that the response seems correct, unbiased, and explainable - does it make sense?",
    "bullet6": "Any questions asked or data entered will not be used to train or improve the current underlying model or future models.",
    "bullet7": "During these early learning days, do not rely on these responses without taking additional verification steps for critical business purposes or for decisions with significant impacts (employment/hiring, financial, legal, healthcare applications or decisions, etc.).",
    "bullet8": "McKesson Security teams and Microsoft will be monitoring all use in this McKesson GPT environment. Anyone using this application expressly consents to such monitoring. If such monitoring reveals possible activity which violates company policy and/or the law, system personnel may provide this information to relevant company legal/ethical channels and/or to law enforcement officials."
